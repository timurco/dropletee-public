Last updated: February 20, 2026

Data Controller. Towards Inner Momentum, developer of the Dropletee plugin for Adobe After Effects. For any privacy-related inquiries, contact us at aescripts.com/contact or open an issue in this repository.

Information We Collect. When you use the Dropletee plugin, we may collect the following technical and diagnostic data: plugin version and build information; host application name and version; operating system and hardware architecture; license activation status and license provider; name associated with your license as provided by the license retailer; crash reports including signal type and stack trace addresses; error diagnostics such as error type, component, and recent log entries; and an anonymous machine identifier derived from a one-way hash of hardware attributes. We do not access or transmit your project files, compositions, layer content, file paths, keystrokes, email addresses, or license keys.

Purpose and Legal Basis. We process this data on the basis of legitimate interest (GDPR Article 6(1)(f)) for the following purposes: diagnosing and fixing crashes and errors, monitoring plugin stability across different platforms and configurations, resolving licensing and activation issues, verifying software integrity and detecting unauthorized modifications, and improving overall plugin quality.

Third-Party Processors. Analytics data is transmitted to and processed by PostHog (posthog.com), hosted on EU servers in Frankfurt, Germany. PostHog acts as a data processor on our behalf. No data is sold or shared with other third parties.

Data Retention. Analytics and crash data is retained for up to 12 months, after which it is automatically deleted.

Your Rights. Under GDPR and applicable privacy laws, you have the right to access the data we hold about you, request correction of inaccurate data, request deletion of your data, object to data processing based on legitimate interest, and receive your data in a structured format (data portability). To exercise any of these rights, contact us using the details in the Data Controller section above.

Opt-Out. You may disable all analytics collection at any time by creating an empty file named .posthog_optout in your home directory (`~/.posthog_optout` on macOS/Linux, `%USERPROFILE%\.posthog_optout` on Windows). When this file is present, no data is collected or transmitted. To re-enable analytics, delete the file.

Changes to This Policy. We may update this policy from time to time. Changes will be posted in this repository. Continued use of the plugin after changes are posted constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
